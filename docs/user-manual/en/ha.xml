    <title>High Availability and Failover</title>
    <para>We define high availability as the <emphasis>ability for the system to continue
            functioning after failure of one or more of the servers</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>A part of high availability is <emphasis>failover</emphasis> which we define as the
            <emphasis>ability for client connections to migrate from one server to another in event
            of server failure so client applications can continue to operate</emphasis>.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Live - Backup Pairs</title>
        <para>HornetQ allows pairs of servers to be linked together as <emphasis>live -
                backup</emphasis> pairs. In this release there is a single backup server for each
            live server. A backup server is owned by only one live server. Backup servers are not
            operational until failover occurs.</para>
        <para>Before failover, only the live server is serving the HornetQ clients while the backup
            server remains passive. When clients fail over to the backup server, the backup server
            becomes active and starts to service the HornetQ clients.</para>
        <section id="ha.mode">
            <title>HA modes</title>
            <para>HornetQ provides two different modes for high availability, either by
                    <emphasis>replicating data</emphasis> from the live server journal to the backup
                server or using a <emphasis>shared store</emphasis> for both servers.</para>
            <note>
                <para>Only persistent message data will survive failover. Any non persistent message
                    data will not be available after failover.</para>
            </note>
            <section id="ha.mode.replicated">
                <title>Data Replication</title>
                <para>In this mode, data stored in the HornetQ journal are replicated from the live
                    server's journal to the backup server's journal. Note that we do not replicate
                    the entire server state, we only replicate the journal and other persistent
                    operations.</para>
                <para>Replication is performed in an asynchronous fashion between live and backup
                    server. Data is replicated one way in a stream, and responses that the data has
                    reached the backup is returned in another stream. Pipelining replications and
                    responses to replications in separate streams allows replication throughput to
                    be much higher than if we synchronously replicated data and waited for a
                    response serially in an RPC manner before replicating the next piece of
                    data.</para>
                <para>When the user receives confirmation that a transaction has committed, prepared
                    or rolled back or a durable message has been sent, we can guarantee it has
                    reached the backup server and been persisted.</para>
                <para>Data replication introduces some inevitable performance overhead compared to
                    non replicated operation, but has the advantage in that it requires no expensive
                    shared file system (e.g. a SAN) for failover, in other words it is a <emphasis
                        role="italic">shared-nothing</emphasis> approach to high
                    availability.</para>
                <para>Failover with data replication is also faster than failover using shared
                    storage, since the journal does not have to be reloaded on failover at the
                    backup node.</para>

                    <title>Configuration</title>
                    <para>First, on the live server, in <literal
                        >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>, configure the live server with
                        knowledge of its backup server. This is done by specifying a <literal
                            >backup-connector-ref</literal> element. This element references a
                        connector, also specified on the live server which specifies how to connect
                        to the backup server.</para>
                    <para>Here's a snippet from live server's <literal
                            >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> configured to connect to its backup
                        server:</para>
                    <programlisting>
  &lt;backup-connector-ref connector-name="backup-connector"/>

  &lt;connectors>
     &lt;!-- This connector specifies how to connect to the backup server    -->
     &lt;!-- backup server is located on host "192.168.0.11" and port "5445" -->

       &lt;param key="port" value="5445"/>
     &lt;/connector>
  &lt;/connectors></programlisting>
                    <para>Secondly, on the backup server, we flag the server as a backup and make
                        sure it has an acceptor that the live server can connect to. We also make
                        sure the shared-store paramater is set to false:</para>
                    <programlisting>

              </programlisting>
                    <para>For a backup server to function correctly it's also important that it has
                        the same set of bridges, predefined queues, cluster connections, broadcast
                        groups and discovery groups as defined on the live node. The easiest way to
                        ensure this is to copy the entire server side configuration from live to
                        backup and just make the changes as specified above. </para>

                    <title>Synchronizing a Backup Node to a Live Node</title>
                    <para>In order for live - backup pairs to operate properly, they must be
                        identical replicas. This means you cannot just use any backup server that's
                        previously been used for other purposes as a backup server, since it will
                        have different data in its persistent storage. If you try to do so, you will
                        receive an exception in the logs and the server will fail to start.</para>
                    <para>To create a backup server for a live server that's already been used for
                        other purposes, it's necessary to copy the <literal>data</literal> directory
                        from the live server to the backup server. This means the backup server will
                        have an identical persistent store to the backup server.</para>
                    <para>Once a live server has failed over onto a backup server, the old live
                        server becomes invalid and cannot just be restarted. To resynchonize the
                        pair as a working live backup pair again, both servers need to be stopped,
                        the data copied from the live node to the backup node and restarted
                        again.</para>
                    <para>The next release of HornetQ will provide functionality for automatically
                        synchronizing a new backup node to a live node without having to temporarily
                        bring down the live node.</para>

            </section>
            <section id="ha.mode.shared">
                <title>Shared Store</title>
                <para>When using a shared store, both live and backup servers share the
                        <emphasis>same</emphasis> entire data directory using a shared file system.
                    This means the paging directory, journal directory, large messages and binding
                    journal.</para>
                <para>When failover occurs and the backup server takes over, it will load the
                    persistent storage from the shared file system and clients can connect to
                    it.</para>
                <para>This style of high availability differs from data replication in that it
                    requires a shared file system which is accessible by both the live and backup
                    nodes. Typically this will be some kind of high performance Storage Area Network
                    (SAN). We do not recommend you use Network Attached Storage (NAS), e.g. NFS
                    mounts to store any shared journal (NFS is slow).</para>
                <para>The advantage of shared-store high availability is that no replication occurs
                    between the live and backup nodes, this means it does not suffer any performance
                    penalties due to the overhead of replication during normal operation.</para>
                <para>The disadvantage of shared store replication is that it requires a shared file
                    system, and when the backup server activates it needs to load the journal from
                    the shared store which can take some time depending on the amount of data in the
                    store.</para>
                <para>If you require the highest performance during normal operation, have access to
                    a fast SAN, and can live with a slightly slower failover (depending on amount of
                    data), we recommend shared store high availability</para>

        <para>HornetQ also provides 100% transparent automatic reattachment of connections to the

            <para>HornetQ clients can be configured with the list of live-backup server pairs in a

                client to automatically discover the list. For full details on how to configure
                server discovery, please see <xref linkend="clusters.server-discovery"/>.
                Alternatively, the clients can explicitly specifies pairs of live-backup server as

                fail after this number of attempts.</para>
            <para>In some cases, you may want the client to automatically try the backup server it
                fails to make an initial connection to the live server. In this case you can set the

                <title>A Note on Server Replication</title>
                <para>HornetQ does not replicate full server state between live and backup servers.
                    When the new session is automatically recreated on the backup it won't have any
                    knowledge of messages already sent or acknowledged in that session. Any
                    in-flight sends or acknowledgements at the time of failover might also be
                    lost.</para>
                <para>By replicating full server state, theoretically we could provide a 100%
                    transparent seamless failover, which would avoid any lost messages or
                    acknowledgements, however this comes at a great cost: replicating the full
                    server state (including the queues, session, etc.). This would require
                    replication of the entire server state machine; every operation on the live
                    server would have to replicated on the replica server(s) in the exact same
                    global order to ensure a consistent replica state. This is extremely hard to do
                    in a performant and scalable way, especially when one considers that multiple
                    threads are changing the live server state concurrently.</para>
                <para>It is possible to provide full state machine replication using techniques such
                    as <emphasis role="italic">virtual synchrony</emphasis>, but this does not scale
                    well and effectively serializes all operations to a single thread, dramatically
                    reducing concurrency.</para>
                <para>Other techniques for multi-threaded active replication exist such as
                    replicating lock states or replicating thread scheduling but this is very hard
                    to achieve at a Java level.</para>
                <para>Consequently it has decided it was not worth massively reducing performance
                    and concurrency for the sake of 100% transparent failover. Even without 100%
                    transparent failover, it is simple to guarantee <emphasis role="italic">once and
                        only once</emphasis> delivery, even in the case of failure, by using a
                    combination of duplicate detection and retrying of transactions. However this is
                    not 100% transparent to the client code.</para>

                <para>If the client code is in a blocking call to the server, waiting for a response
                    to continue its execution, when failover occurs, the new session will not have
                    any knowledge of the call that was in progress. This call might otherwise hang

                <para>To prevent this, HornetQ will unblock any blocking calls that were in progress
                    at the time of failover by making them throw a <literal

                <para>If the session is transactional and messages have already been sent or

                    it is already rolled back. The user can then just retry the transactional
                    operations again on the same session.</para>

                <para>If failover occurs when a commit call is being executed, the server, as
                    previously described, will unblock the call to prevent a hang, since no response
                    will come back. In this case it is not easy for the client to determine whether
                    the transaction commit was actually processed on the live server before failure
                    occurred.</para>
                <para>To remedy this, the client can simply enable duplicate detection (<xref
                        linkend="duplicate-detection"/>) in the transaction, and retry the
                    transaction operations again after the call is unblocked. If the transaction had
                    indeed been committed on the live server successfully before failover, then when
                    the transaction is retried, duplicate detection will ensure that any durable
                    messages resent in the transaction will be ignored on the server to prevent them
                    getting sent more than once.</para>

                    <para>By catching the rollback exceptions and retrying, catching unblocked calls

            <para>In some cases you may not want automatic client failover, and prefer to handle any

                failover, since the failover is handled at the user application level.</para>
            <para>To implement application-level failover, if you're using JMS then you need to set
                an <literal>ExceptionListener</literal> class on the JMS connection. The <literal
                    >ExceptionListener</literal> will be called by HornetQ in the event that
                connection failure is detected. In your <literal>ExceptionListener</literal>, you
                would close your old JMS connections, potentially look up new connection factory
                instances from JNDI and creating new connections. In this case you may well be using
                    <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossHAJNDIImpl">HA-JNDI</ulink>
                to ensure that the new connection factory is looked up from a different
